The Office Hours Podcast opens the door to candid conversations with professors. Through these discussions, we explore the human side of academia, sharing professors' personal journeys from their own university days to their current groundbreaking research.

The podcast serves a dual purpose: celebrating outstanding faculty while helping bridge the gap between professors and students who are interested in pursing higher education. Many successful students share one common trait â€“ they actively engage with their professors through office hours, class discussions, and research opportunities. Through these conversations, I hope to demonstrate that our professors are not just educators, but mentors eager to support student success.

Join us as we explore the fascinating world of academia, demystify the Ph.D. journey, and strengthen our community of academics, one conversation at a time - starting with the creators' home community at the University of California, Riverside.
