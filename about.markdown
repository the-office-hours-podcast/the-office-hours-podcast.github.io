The Office Hours Podcast opens the door to candid conversations with professors. Through these discussions, we explore the human side of academia, sharing professors' personal journeys - from their own university days to their current groundbreaking research.

Our podcast serves multiple purposes: celebrating outstanding faculty while helping bridge the gap between professors and students who are interested in pursing higher education. Through these conversations, we hope to demonstrate that professors are not just educators, but mentors eager to support student success. We also want to inspire the next generation of researchers by making academia as accessible as possible. Additionally, with the current cuts to academic funding, we strive to stress the importance of research and the institutions that support it.

Join us as we explore the fascinating world of academia, demystify the Ph.D. journey, and strengthen our community of passionate researchers, one conversation at a time - starting with the creators' home community at the University of California, Riverside.
