The Office Hours Podcast opens the door to candid conversations with UC Riverside's remarkable faculty. Through these discussions, we explore the human side of academia, sharing professors' personal journeys from their own university days to their current groundbreaking research at UCR.

As a UCR student, I've experienced firsthand the incredible warmth and accessibility of our professors. Each episode aims to showcase not just their academic achievements, but also their unique stories, industry experiences, and the wisdom they've gained along the way.

The podcast serves a dual purpose: celebrating UCR's outstanding faculty while helping bridge the gap between professors and students. Many successful UCR students share one common trait â€“ they actively engage with their professors through office hours, class discussions, and research opportunities. Through these conversations, I hope to demonstrate that our professors are not just educators, but mentors eager to support student success.

Join us as we explore the fascinating world of academia, demystify the Ph.D. journey, and strengthen our UCR community, one conversation at a time.
