In this pilot episode of The Office Hours Podcast, we invade the office of Dr. Allan Knight at the University of California, Riverside. Throughout the episode, we dive into his own nontraditional journey with a Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Barbra, his previous research and present research in technology for education, and a slice of the communities that he's been a part of over his years.

On the UCR campus, Dr. Knight is a beam of light for his community. Always keeping a lighthearted and playful tone in the lecture hall, he molds the environment around him to be one of the most accessible and inviting learning spaces on campus. Outside the lecture hall, he actively engages with our community of students. From hackathons to the game development club on campus (Gamespawn), he brings his warm company to every student on campus. Thank you Allan for your time on the podcast and your kind presence on campus.
